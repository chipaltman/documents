# I Called System76
I called System76 today because I want to buy one of their computers, but I don't know if now is a good time. I tried to research their hardware model update schedule. I tried asking around on the internet. Neither of these strategies was fruitful. Then this happened, a friendly friend who goes by [@hund](https://linuxrocks.online/@hund) on [linuxrocks.online](linuxrocks.online) said, "Why not ask them directly? :)"

## Challenge Accepted

So I called the good people over in Denver to have them answer me these questions three:

1. What is your favorite color?

	**Blue.**

1. Can you give me some information about when System76 releases new models of existing computer lines? In particular, I'm looking at Wild Dog Pro and Kudu. I don't want to buy one two days before a new model becomes available or the price drops on an older 
model.

	**System76 updates their computer offerings when new processors become available for them. The Wild Dog Pro got a new 8th generation processor in late 2017. Wild Dog won't be updated again until late 2018 or early 2019 when it gets a 9th generation processor.**

	**A new Kudu with an 8th generation processor should appear Summer 2018, maybe in June.**

1. Let's say, hypothetically, I bought a computer from System76 and decided to install Arch Linux on it. If I find myself completely stumped regarding some problem and the Arch community snubs be because I'm a noob can I call you guys with questions?

	**Nope. If you call us we will make fun of you too.**

	*(Full disclosure: That's not at all what they said. Well, they did say no, but I think we all knew that was coming. Then it was more along the lines of 'We won't be much help, but Arch keeps up with our drivers like a boss so you should be fine'.)*

1. Do you only have *Ubuntu* super keys? I mean, that's better than a Windows super key, but I'm a distro hopper...

	**Actually, we will soon have Pop!_OS super keys. I can't say for sure, but the new Kudu might get one. The symbol on the new super key is a square with a line at each side; it's intended to evoke the Gnome Shell Activities Overview.**

## Closing Remark

That's what I call customer service! :smile:
