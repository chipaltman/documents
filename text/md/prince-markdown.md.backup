# Prince Markdown
Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, lived a princess fair (*i.e.* a month ago or so, right here on my computer, and it was me and I'm totally a dude). Her father spoke of word processors, and her duty to the kingdom. She must produce great works of blog and whatnot to share the seeds of her wisdom far and wide to a whole lot of nobody cares.

All the word processors in the land came to try to win her hand, and one by one they dissappointed her. Each came with pomp and pedigree, FOSS and otherwise, the same; "Feature Rich" and "Browser Based" and slow and ugly, lumbering.

She demanded tests of skill, "Make me a PDF" she said,

"And mark up coded messages that I may cast into the web.

Above all, trust my sense of taste â€”

My word is law, and you are lowly men."
