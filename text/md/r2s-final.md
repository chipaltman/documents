## What parts of the lesson or activity addressed the specific parts of the 4C’s?


> **Critical Thinking** was addressed in Objectives 1 and 2: *Rough Draft and Peer Review*.

> **Creativity** was addressed in Objectives 1, 2, and 4: *Rough Draft, Peer Review, and Production*.

> **Communication** was addressed in Objectives 2, 3, and 4: *Peer Review, Presentation, and Production*.

> **Collaboration** was addressed in Objective 4: *Production.*

## How would you change this lesson for the next time?

I searched for a suitable iPad app to use for graphic design, and I was not successful in finding one. For the next time, I'd like to have more access to computers that can run a wider variety of software. 

I would like to create a more strict format for Objective 3: *Presentation* before using this lesson again. Asking students to present their ideas was time consuming, and was not as fruitful as their smaller group conversations. 

## Reinforcement

> **Activities and Materials**

This lesson, and my lessons in general, are exemplary with regards to Activities and Materials according to the South Carolina Teaching Standards 4.0 Rubric which states the following:

> **Exemplary (4)**: Activities and materials include all of the following:

>* support the lesson
objectives
* are challenging
* sustain students’ attention
* elicit a variety of thinking
* provide time for reflection
* are relevant to students’
lives
* provide opportunities for
student-to-student
interaction
* induce student curiosity and
suspense
* provide students with
choices
* incorporate multimedia and
technology which enhances
student learning and
thinking
* incorporate resources
beyond the school
curriculum texts *(e.g.,
teacher made materials,
manipulatives, resources
from museums, cultural
centers, etc.)*
* In addition, sometimes
activities are game-like,
involve simulations, require
creating products, and
demand self-direction and
self-monitoring

I put a great deal of time and effort toward making my lessons as memorable as possible. My own interests vary widely, and I am a life-long learner by nature. I'm thankful for it, and it's not an exaggeration to say my daily habits exemplify inquiry based learning. *(With regards to learning, I feel like the Apostle Paul in I Corinthians 11:1 when he said "follow me as I follow Christ").* It's easy for me to incorporate all manner of *"arts disciplines, other subjects, and career paths"* into practically every lesson I prepare *(General Music Anchor Standard 9).*

I value divergent thinking. It suits me to "fix things that ain't broken", as they say. This lesson involved creating a game — which is just the sort of thing I do for fun. I value self-direction and choice, curiosity, challenges, technology, reflection... literally everything in the above list. 

Unfortunately, I can't say the same for some of the other principles in the SCTS Rubric but on this one point I feel confident; basically any part of my lesson plan for this project could be cut and pasted here as an example to answer this reflection question.

## Refinement
> **Standards and Objectives**

This lesson, and my lessons in general, are weak with regards to Standards and Objectives according to the South Carolina Teaching Standards 4.0 Rubric which states the following:

> **Exemplary (4)**

> * All learning objectives and
state content standards are
explicitly communicated
* Expectations for each
student’s performance are
clear, demanding, and high
* **State standards are
displayed, referenced
throughout the lesson with
explanations**
* There is evidence that most
students demonstrate
mastery of the objective

Just reading through a few of these principles raises my blood pressure. I'm not blind to flaws in my personality, and I put *some effort* into overcoming them. To do so I struggle against an inconvenient tendency to subconsciously ignore things that cause me stress. Of all my several flaws, the most difficult one for me to overcome is blatant: a stubborn aversion to "toeing the line". I would be an awful soldier.

I've made some progress this year with regards to remembering and doing things I need to do that I'm not exited about. The most helpful adjustment has been relying on colleagues and mentors for accountability. I greatly appreciate their willingness to help me stay in line, as it were, and I try to give back what I can.

One of the principles listed above is in bold, **state standards are displayed, referenced throughout the lesson with explanations.** I have not done this consistently, and it would be very simple to do so. This is a concrete, actionable goal I can implement immediately. 

With regards to explicitly communicating standards to students, this is much easier now with the updated *Standards for General Music,* so why haven't I been doing it? All of my lessons follow multiple standards, because thankfully, the new standards are an excellent, well imagined-guide; all I need to do is post them visibly in the classroom and point at them every day. 

With regards to high expectations for *each student's* mastery of objectives, I will need to do some research, consult with colleagues, and most of all put my mind to it. My tendency is to nurture the interests of my interested students, which by itself is a good thing and native to my personality. I'm considering that it's the students who *don't* show interest who may need my attention more. This is a difficult thing to do when others show intrinsic motivation.
