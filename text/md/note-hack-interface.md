# Designing a Game
*Design a game for learning rhythm notation.*

**In This Lesson:** Students will build upon preliminary work toward developing a rhythm notation game by designing the "look and feel" of an application user interface.

**Technology:** Students will use analog technology (*e.g. paper, pencil, dry-erase board, marker)*. Students will use digital graphic design technology (*e.g. GNU Image Manipulation Program)*.

## Music Education Standards

**Anchor Standard 9:** *I can relate music to other arts disciplines, other subjects, and career paths (p.226)*.

**Readiness for Anchor Standard 5:** *I can read and notate music (p.234)*.

**The Four Cs:**

*Collaboration* — Students will contribute toward one shared project.

*Communication* — Students will work together, sharing ideas, arriving at consensus or compromise.

*Critical Thinking* — Students will be provided with a list of elements to include in their design. They must solve the problems of including these elements in a graphic interface design.

*Creativity* — Students will  begin by working alone, writing and drawing their own ideas. In this task they are not constrained; they will be free to change or add any game element.

## List of Elements
* reference of "commands"
	* split, trash, untrash

* a text-input terminal
* music notation to be manipulated


## Objective 1 — Rough Draft

*Individual, Critical Thinking, Creativity*


On paper, design a rough draft for the appearance of a user interface for the game *Note Hack*. This is a common practice in the world of graphic design; artists begin with simple media to engage their creativity before transferring it to a digital medium.

## Objective 2 — Peer Review

*In Groups, Communication, Critical Thinking*

With others, share and discuss your ideas. Check whether your drafts include elements from the List of Elements. If any elements have been changed be prepared to explain your decision.

## Objective 3 — Presentation

*In Groups, Communication*

As a group, share your ideas with the class.

## Objective 4 — Production

*As a Class, Collaboration, Communication, Creativity*

Transfer ideas to a digital medium using an image editing application *(e.g. GIMP).*
