"Greetings and salutations and thank you for clicking on the [post]." (That was my best Joe Collins impersonation. I hope you liked it.)

I've decided to post my to-do list here in public because I figure you won't mind. Not that I ever get around to actually *completing* to-do lists... we'll see how this goes #shrug

* annular button on Elecom M-XT3DR trackball
	* waiting for a driver patch
* enable compose key
* use **mv** to sort files by extension
