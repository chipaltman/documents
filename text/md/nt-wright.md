Theology needs history. At least, Christian theology needs history but it hasn't always known what to do with it. Anyone who prays for God's kingdom to come on earth as in heaven is committed to space-time-and-matter existence, not to illustrate abstract principles but as the reality to which abstract principles bear humble witness. Jesus, in other words, is not an illustration, even the ultimate illustration, of true doctrine. Principles and doctrines refer to him and must defer to him and this means history. Doing theology, including natural theology, without history, is like playing the violin without a bow. Pizzicato theology, if you like.
