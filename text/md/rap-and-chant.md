### The Pledge of Allegience
### How Singing *Probably* Began
* All talking *is* singing.
* What we call "singing" is:
	* talking with **meaningless** pitch
	* instead of meaning, pitch is used for art
	* ... *or at first* just to **be heard**

### How Harmony *Probably* Began
* Everyone sang the same pitches
	* That's **unison**
* One person couldn't do that...
	* We'll call him "Bill"
* Everyone else just let him have his *one note*

As it turns out, Bill's one note sounded good if they let it be the **resting tone**.
### Rap and Chant
